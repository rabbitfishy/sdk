# sdk

This is an sdk base that I've been working on.
Originally is for personal use and to practice with. 
However, my hard drive keep corrupting the sdk.
So I decided to upload here and download it whenever without the worry of being courrupted.
You can use it if you want, primarily this project is for personal use and a safe place to keep it.
